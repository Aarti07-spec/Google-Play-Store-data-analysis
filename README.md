# Google-Play-Store-data-analysis
"Data analysis of the Google Play Store dataset using Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib). Includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visual exploration, and insights on app ratings, installs, and categories."


## 🔷 Introduction

The Google Play Store houses millions of apps across diverse categories, making it a rich ecosystem to analyze user behavior, app performance, and market trends.
This project performs a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Google Play Store dataset to uncover meaningful insights related to app categories, ratings, installs, pricing, and popularity trends.

The goal is to transform raw, inconsistent data into a structured and visually interpretable form using Python-based analysis and visualizations.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of the analysis were to:

Clean and preprocess a raw Google Play Store dataset.

Explore patterns in app ratings, installs, categories, and pricing.

Visualize key insights through charts (bar, pie, histogram, scatter).

Understand relationships between app performance metrics (e.g., ratings vs installs).

Build a reproducible, portfolio-ready analysis notebook.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

## 🛠️ Detailed Project Breakdown
#### 🔸 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values (rating, type, size)

Converted installs from “10,000+” → 10000

Converted price from “$2.99” → 2.99

Standardized categories and content rating

Converted Size column to numerical by handling “M”, “k”, “Varies with device”

#### 🔸 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used descriptive statistics and grouped insights to understand:

Most common categories

Rating distribution

Difference between Free and Paid apps

Trends in installs

Relationship between rating, price, and installs

#### 🔸 3. Data Visualization

Created multiple charts to visually understand and present findings.


### 📊 Charts
##### 📌 1.Number of Apps by Category (Bar Graph)

This bar graph shows the distribution of applications across different categories on the Google Play Store. It highlights categories with the highest number of apps, indicating areas with strong developer activity and competition.

##### 📌 2. Installs by Category (Bar Graph)

This graph represents the total number of installs for each app category. Categories such as Games and Communication show the highest installs, reflecting strong user demand.

##### 📌 3. Rating Distribution (Histogram)

This histogram illustrates the distribution of app ratings. Most apps are rated between 4.0 and 4.5, indicating generally positive user feedback.

##### 📌 4. Reviews vs Installs (Scatter Plot)

This scatter plot shows the relationship between the number of installs and reviews using a logarithmic scale. A positive correlation suggests that apps with more installs tend to receive more reviews.

##### 📌 5. App Size vs Rating (Scatter Plot)

This graph analyzes the relationship between app size and user ratings. It shows that app size does not significantly affect ratings, as highly rated apps appear across all size ranges.

##### 📌 6. Content Rating Distribution (Bar Graph)

This bar graph displays the number of apps based on content rating categories. The dominance of “Everyone” rated apps suggests a preference for apps suitable for a wide audience.

##### 📌 7. Revenue by Category (Bar Graph)

This graph represents the total revenue generated by the top app categories. Business and Productivity categories lead in revenue, indicating strong monetization potential.

##### 📌 8. Top Genres (Bar Graph)

This graph shows the most common app genres available on the Play Store. Action and Casual genres appear most frequently, reflecting user interest in entertainment-focused applications.

##### 📌 9. App Releases Over the Years (Line Graph)

This line graph shows the trend of app releases over time. The increasing pattern highlights the rapid growth of the mobile app ecosystem.

##### 📌 10. Ratings for Paid vs Free Apps (Box Plot)

This box plot compares ratings between paid and free apps. Paid apps generally have higher median ratings, suggesting higher user expectations and perceived quality.


## 📈 Interactive HTML Dashboard

An HTML-based dashboard was created to combine all visualizations into a single, interactive interface.

Key Features:

All graphs displayed in one place

Interactive hover effects for better data understanding

Dark-themed layout for improved readability

Standalone HTML files for easy sharing and access

This dashboard allows users to explore insights quickly without running the notebook.

#### 🖥️ Tkinter-Based Desktop Dashboard

A desktop GUI dashboard was developed using Tkinter to present the same analysis in an offline environment.

Dashboard Features:

Scrollable window layout

Embedded charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Visualization of categories, installs, ratings, revenue, and genres

Sentiment analysis of user reviews

Comparison of paid vs free app ratings

Machine learning evaluation results

This version demonstrates how data analysis can be converted into a desktop application.


## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following skills were strengthened:

##### 🔹 Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Converting categorical/numerical formats

Standardizing text fields

Fixing inconsistent symbols (e.g., “+”, “M”, “$”)

##### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis

Grouping and aggregating data

Feature interpretation

Identifying outliers and trends

##### 🔹 Data Visualization

Designing clear and meaningful charts

Understanding chart selection (bar, histogram, scatter)

Interpreting visual trends for business insights

##### 🔹 Python Libraries

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib for visualization

## 📝 Conclusion

This Google Play Store data analysis project successfully demonstrates the complete workflow of transforming raw data into actionable insights.
The analysis revealed important trends such as:

Most apps belong to a few dominating categories

Majority of apps are free

Higher installs tend to align with better ratings

Paid apps follow predictable pricing patterns

The final notebook showcases strong analytical thinking, Python skills, and the ability to communicate insights through clean visualizations — making it a strong addition to a data analytics portfolio.
